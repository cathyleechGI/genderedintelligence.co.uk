<p>Gendered Intelligence (GI) is a registered not-for-profit charity, established in 2008. Our mission is to increase understandings of gender diversity and to improve the lives of trans people. We work predominantly with the trans community and those who impact on trans lives; we particularly specialise in supporting young trans people aged 8-30.</p>

<h2>Join the team</h2>
<p>Gendered Intelligence consists of a team of skilled trainers, youth workers, mentors, public speakers, consultants, workshop facilitators and community practitioners, who are supported by individuals with administrative, finance, research, policy, communications and IT skills.  We have a working and in-depth knowledge of the wider trans community and of the young trans community in particular. </p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence is a trans-led organisation, which means most members of the team are trans. We feel strongly that there is not one way of being trans, and there are many different ways and approaches to help GI achieve its aims. </p>

<p>We are keen to ensure that collectively the team is diverse in order that we can draw from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives and styles of thinking and working. As the organisation grows this is more important than ever. </p>


<h2>Vacancies</h2>
We currently have no open roles. Please check back soon!<br><br>
