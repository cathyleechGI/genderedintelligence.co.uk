<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2>

<br><br>
<p>Last week the Cass Review released their interim report. We have welcomed the report, particularly its urgent recommendation of a new system of gender-affirming care, and its timely reminder that all young people are entitled to timely, age appropriate, high-quality healthcare under the NHS.</p>
<br>
<p>We understand that there have been a wide range of interpretations of this report, from those who support better access to gender-affirming care and those who do not. A particular source of distress has been what is meant by “affirmative” and “exploratory” models of care. We are confident that this report does not recommend that trans and non-binary young people have their identity suppressed or ignored, and that gender-affirmation and exploration go hand in hand.</p>
<br>
<p>We look to the guidelines published by the British Psychological Society, which stress that exploration of, for instance, trans identity can – and should – go hand in hand with affirmation of that identity as a legitimate outcome. Likewise, we are confident that the process of differential diagnosis described in this report is not intended to preferentially diagnose other conditions as an alternative to trans identity, but to provide appropriate care for all trans young people. These same guidelines also remind us that those working with young people “should be careful not to assume that bisexuality, non-binary genders, or other forms of sexuality, gender, or relationships are ‘just a phase’ […] All sexualities, genders and relationship forms are possibilities.”</p>
<br>
<p>We do not agree with all the outcomes of the interim report. We are currently bringing a judicial review against NHS England together with the Good Law Project and a group of trans adults and children regarding the provision of gender identity services in the UK. One of our grounds of claim is that trans and non-binary people face additional and unnecessary barriers to healthcare – including the Multi-Professional Review Group – which we argue are discriminatory. As such, we cannot support the Cass Review’s continued recommendation that the MPRG be kept in place. However, we welcome the Cass Review’s key aims of improving access to healthcare for trans and non-binary young people and reducing spiralling wait times for services.</p>
<br>
<p>Gendered Intelligence will continue to support all young people in pursuing their right to receive the healthcare that they are entitled to, a commitment that we broadly share with the Cass Review. We understand that the Review as a whole is a work in progress, with developing terminologies and recommendations. An unfortunate side-effect of this is that parties who completely oppose gender-affirming care have interpreted this report to fit their aims. We want to encourage those on social media to avoid misinformation, and to reassure the community that we remain confident in our mutual aim of supporting and caring for all trans youth.</p>
