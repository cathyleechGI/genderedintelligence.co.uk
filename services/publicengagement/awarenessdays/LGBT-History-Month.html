 in which he proposes a theory of love and identity that accounts for a range of sexualities and gender identities –

					    Often the perception is that LGBT+ acceptance is a relatively recent phenomenon, 
					    but there is plenty of evidence that this is not the case. Sexual and gender diversity 
					    are present throughout recorded history, and was often much more widely accepted than the present day. <br>

Until this point marriages had been governed by canon law, and there were few legal requirements. Although canon law did not permit equal marriage, we can speculate that prior to the introduction of legal restrictions it would have been possible for a person ‘living as a man/woman’ to get married with comparative ease. This Act marks a turning point from which who can get married -  and how - is increasingly regulated and monitored by the state.</span>
