<h2>About</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence Support Line launched in 2018 with a partnership with Nottingham Centre for Transgender Health, offering independent and confidential support to trans and non-binary patients (and their families) undergoing the NHS gender care waiting list and assessment process. The Support Line is now offering support to gender care patients at our new NHS partner Sheffield Porterbrook Clinic as well as continuing support services at the Nottingham Centre for Transgender Health.</p>

<p>The GI Support Line Team are here to listen. We can offer you support and a listening ear at this difficult time for patients of gender services. We can offer you an informed gender diverse listening ear, and trans affirmative support from workers who are all trans and non-binary people themselves.</p>

<p>Get in touch:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To access confidential support</p></li>
<li><p>To source helpful information</p></li>
<li><p>To chat about resilience and self-care</p></li>
<li><p>To talk about how you might handle difficult times</p></li>
<li><p>To look at taking care of yourself in terms of holistic wellbeing</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to start a conversation. We can offer a call back, or spend time exchanging messaging. If we are busy or closed, you can email or leave a text or WhatsApp message and the support worker can get back to you.</p>
