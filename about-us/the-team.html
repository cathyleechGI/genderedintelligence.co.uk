Chryssy has a research background in equality and diversity. Her research has focused on the impact of the Equality Act 2010 on the lives of the most marginalised, centring the lives of trans and sexgender nonconforming people, and drawing on her own lived experience as a trans woman. Chryssy brings this experience to her work with GI and the Board. Chryssy is also active in work with LGBTQ+ prisoners with the Bent Bars Project, and helped set up TAGS for trans and sexgender nonconforming swimmers.<br><br>

Chryssy facilitated a workshop on prison abolition at the GI Supercamp and gave a paper at the Transforming Spaces Conference about the politics of trans prisoners. Outside of GI Chryssy works in the LGBTQ charity sector for Opening Doors London, helping over 50s in our communities overcome isolation and loneliness.<br><br>

Chryssy feels that living overseas on three continents for 10 years has given her some appreciation of the lives of others and a different perspective on the privileges and challenges of our lives in the UK, especially as a trans woman in these uncertain and seemingly disenfranchised times. Chryssy is also a proud parent.
