                <p>Gendered Intelligence, established in 2008, is a registered charity that works to increase understandings of gender diversity and improve the lives of trans people. We are a trans-led and trans-involving grassroots organisation with a wealth of lived experience, community connections of many kinds, and an exemplary depth and breadth of trans community knowledge, backed with rigorous academic thinking and knowledge to PhD level.<br><br>
Gendered Intelligence imagines a world where people are no longer constrained by narrow perceptions and expectations of gender, and where diverse gender expressions are visible and valued.  We believe everyone can be intelligent about gender.<br><br>
Trans experiences provide a valuable lens through which we can examine our cultural perspective on gender, and we believe it enhances everyone’s life to open up more possibilities and options and remove unnecessary gender-based constraints. We work with trans communities and those who impact on trans lives; we particularly specialise in supporting young trans people aged 8-30. Our work aims to better trans lives through: the delivery of professional educational services such as trans awareness training and consultancy; a large youth service; a support line; mentoring in education; affecting public policy, working with the media and carrying out research; as well as many other projects and services.
