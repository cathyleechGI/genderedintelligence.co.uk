<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<div id="coronavirus"></div>

<p><strong>We offer both online AND in person youth group sessions.</strong></p>

<p>A full calendar of online youth groups can be found <a href="youth-group.html#calendar">here</a>. Please contact us on youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk if you need to talk to a youth worker.</p>

<h2>Youth Groups for Young Trans and Gender Variant People</h2>

<div id="generalinfo">Gendered Intelligence run trans youth groups in London and Leeds for a range of ages from 7 to 30. We also run a peer-led support group in London for those aged 18-30.<br><br>

Young trans people aged 11 or over are welcome to attend our Under 16 group in London and our Saturday sessions in London. If you are at Primary school, or aged between 8 – 11, you can attend our special under 12s group with a parent/ carer. At the moment, our groups in Leeds are open for young people aged 13-20. If you are a young trans person under the age of 13 or over 20 in these areas, and would like some support, please <a href="../contact/email">get in touch</a>.<br><br>

<p>Our youth groups are open to <strong>all young trans people</strong>, no matter how you identify or whether you are questioning your gender. We use trans as an umbrealla term and are fully inclusive of non-binary individuals; please don't worry about not feeling 'trans enough'.</p><br><br>

<b>There is no fee to access our youth group, and we can reimburse travel for at least £7 per person at every session if the cost of travel would prevent you from getting to the groups. <br> <br>

At the youth groups you can:</b>

<br>

<ul><li>Meet other young trans, transgender, non-binary or gender questioning people, socialise, make friends, have fun and get some support</li>
<li>Find out information about coming out / disclosing, transitioning, your rights as a trans child, teenager or young adult, how to negotiate life post-transition, and more</li>
<li>Have a safe and supportive space to explore your gender identity if you're questioning, be yourself if you're not out, or have an opportunity to chat about trans stuff.</li></ul></div>

<h2>Online Youth Groups</h2>

<p>We are currently running youth groups online alongside ourin person sessions.</p> 

<div id="online">Please email <a href="mailto:youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk"><b>youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk</a></b> with the subject <strong>‘ONLINE YOUTH GROUPS’.</strong> Include your name, age, whereabouts you live in the country and if you are ok with being contacted by phone, by a GI youth worker. A worker will arrange a time to call you, this is an initial check-in and find out your needs for being involved. You don’t have to send any details at first if you just want to ask us a question. If you don’t want to speak on the phone we can email back and forward with you to assess your needs. Once you have spoken with us and shared your membership details with us, you will hear from one of our Lead Youth Worker’s depending on the group/s you can join as to when the next online spaces will be held. 
<br><br>
<b>Then what?</b>
The lead youth worker will then send you and email with a link to the online space.
<br><br>
These are trying times, but as trans people our community is familiar with overcoming challenges and we will adapt. <i>If you're a young trans person, please know that we have no intentions of leaving you to face the times ahead without support - we will continue to support you for as long as we can</i>. If you're worried about how things are, or concerned about your well-being or safety if you need to isolate, let us know and we will do what we can to support you.
