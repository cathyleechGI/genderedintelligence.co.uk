<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<div id="coronavirus"></div>

<p>As you will have heard and seen on the news, the covid pandemic has not left us. With concerns high about the Omicron variant, the next month is looking uncertain. We hate that almost 2 years later it feels like a return to the uncertainty of 2020.</p>

<p>In order to keep you, your families and friends, and our youth workers safe, we have made the hard decision not to run any in-person groups in January 2022. We hope and plan to reopen our in-person groups again in February.</p>

<p>We hope to see you on our computer screens in January. A full calendar of online youth groups can be found <a href="youth-group.html#calendar">here</a>. Please contact us on youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk if you need to talk to a youth worker. Remember we are closed from 19th December until 4th January.</p>

<p>Until then, take care, stay warm and stay safe.</p>

<h2>How to join a GI trans, non-binary or questioning online youth group space</h2>

<div id="howtojoin">Please email <a href="mailto:youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk"><b>youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk</a></b> with the subject ‘ONLINE YOUTH GROUPS’. Include your name, age, whereabouts you live in the country and if you are ok with being contacted by phone, by a GI youth worker. A worker will arrange a time to call you, this is an initial check-in and find out your needs for being involved. You don’t have to send any details at first if you just want to ask us a question. If you don’t want to speak on the phone we can email back and forward with you to assess your needs. </div>

<p><br><br><center><b><a href="youth-group.html#top">Back to top</a></b></center></p>

<h2>What will happen next?</h2>

<div id="whatnext">Once you have spoken with us and shared your membership details with us, you will hear from one of our Lead Youth Worker’s depending on the group/s you can join as to when the next online spaces will be held. 
<br><br>
<b>Then what?</b>
The lead youth worker will then send you and email with a link to the online space.
<br><br>
These are trying times, but as trans people our community is familiar with overcoming challenges and we will adapt. <i>If you're a young trans person, please know that we have no intentions of leaving you to face the times ahead without support - we will continue to support you for as long as we can</i>. If you're worried about how things are, or concerned about your well-being or safety if you need to isolate, let us know and we will do what we can to support you.</div>

<h2>Youth Groups for Young Trans and Gender Variant People</h2>

<div id="generalinfo">Gendered Intelligence runs a range of youth groups in London and Leeds for young trans, non-binary and questioning young people. Our groups have different age ranges which you can find out more about below. We also run a young adults peer-led support group in London for those aged 18-30.<br><br>

Young trans people aged 11 or over are welcome to attend our Under 16 group in London and our Saturday sessions in London. If you are at Primary school, or aged between 8 – 11, you can attend our special under 12s group with a parent/ carer. At the moment, our groups in Leeds are open for young people aged 13-20. If you are a young trans person under the age of 13 or over 20 in these areas, and would like some support, please <a href="../contact/email">get in touch</a>.<br><br>

No matter how you identify, Gendered Intelligence's trans youth groups are open to all young trans people - whether you're brand new to identifying as trans, still questioning your identity, worrying about whether you are trans or not, or if you consider yourself to be post-transition or as having a trans history. We strive to be fully inclusive of individuals who identify as non-binary / other, as well as male or female.<br><br>

<b>There is no fee to access our youth group, and we can reimburse travel for at least £7 per person at every session if the cost of travel would prevent you from getting to the groups. <br> <br>

At the youth groups you can:</b>

<br>

<ul><li>Meet other young trans, transgender, non-binary or gender questioning people, socialise, make friends, have fun and get some support</li>
<li>Find out information about coming out / disclosing, transitioning, your rights as a trans child, teenager or young adult, how to negotiate life post-transition, and more</li>
<li>Have a safe and supportive space to explore your gender identity if you're questioning, be yourself if you're not out, or have an opportunity to chat about trans stuff if you're stealth.</li></ul></div>

<h2>Membership</h2>

<div id="membership"></div>

<p><br> You don't need to be a member to attend the GI youth group, but young people who attend our events more than once are asked to become members of Gendered Intelligence youth. This helps us keep you up-to-date with what we're doing, and means you receive priority when applying to attend our arts projects and special trips. It also lets us build a picture of the needs and backgrounds of young people who come to Gendered Intelligence, which helps us make our service more inclusive and accessible for all. <br><center><b><a href="youth-group.html#top">Back to top</a></b></center><br></p>
